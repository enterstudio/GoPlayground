# Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme

More Info about this:

## Actual Implementation

It's stored in the folder `Actual-Implementation` from the `http://point-at-infinity.org` website.

Need to install `libgmp3-dev` package on *ubuntu* for build.

This can be installed by `sudo apt install ssss`

## Plan

We would be writing 2 Implementations :

1. Pure Go Implementation : `github.com/codahale/sss` package
2. Go Service like Implementation : `github.com/SSSaaS/sssa-golang` package
